The dataset consists of multiple flight records with key features, including airline names, journey durations, number of stopovers, departure and arrival times, and routes. These features serve as independent variables, influencing the final price of the tickets.

The dataset is crucial for training the models, allowing them to learn patterns and relationships between flight attributes and ticket prices. Such a model can be instrumental for travel agencies, airlines, and travelers to estimate flight costs and plan bookings efficiently.

For performance optimization, I integrated Intel's oneAPI, an open, unified programming model that enables developers to write code that runs seamlessly on multiple hardware types, including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs.

Using oneAPI’s oneDAL library, I optimized the Random Forest, Ridge Regression and Scikit-Learn to take advantage of hardware accelerators, leading to faster training and prediction times. This enhancement allows the model to provide real-time predictions with high efficiency, even on large datasets.

# Methodology:

​
Intel oneAPI can significantly enhance a flight price prediction system by utilizing its performance optimization capabilities and support for heterogeneous computing. The following steps outline the key approach:

​
### ✅Data Preparation:

Gather historical flight data, including features such as departure and arrival airports, airline, ticket class, departure time, journey duration, and the flight date.

Handle missing values, perform data cleaning, and preprocess categorical variables using encoding techniques. Ensure that data is split appropriately for training and testing.

​

### ✅Feature Engineering:

Extract meaningful features such as travel month, day of the week, and hour of departure. Create additional features, like holiday indicators or flight distance, to improve prediction accuracy.

Use scaling or normalization for numerical features to optimize model performance.

​

### ✅Model Selection:

Choose machine learning models such as Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVR), or Bagging Regressor.

Each model offers a different balance between interpretability, complexity, and accuracy. For high performance, tree-based models like Random Forests are well-suited to complex datasets.

​

### ✅Training and Optimization:

Leverage Intel oneAPI Toolkit and oneDAL (Data Analytics Library) to accelerate training on Intel CPUs, GPUs, or FPGAs.

Utilize parallel processing, vectorization, and threading to improve computation speed and training efficiency, reducing overall runtime.

Perform hyperparameter tuning using methods like RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the models.

​

### ✅Model Evaluation:

Use cross-validation to ensure model robustness. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as R² score, MAE, MSE, and RMSE to measure prediction accuracy.

Experiment with different models and feature sets to ensure the optimal configuration for prediction tasks.

​

### ✅Deployment and Monitoring:

Once the best-performing model is identified, deploy it in a production environment, ensuring scalability and real-time prediction capabilities.

Continuously monitor performance and retrain the model with new flight data to maintain prediction accuracy over time.
